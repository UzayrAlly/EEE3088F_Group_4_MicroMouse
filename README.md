Micro-Mouse Sensing Subsystem
#This repository contains the design documentation and testing procedures for the sensing subsystem of the Micro-Mouse project. The sensing subsystem serves as the "eyes" of the Micro-Mouse, detecting walls within a maze environment using infrared light and providing signals for navigation.

Contents:
Design Decisions: Discusses the initial circuit design, component selection, evaluation, and final design of the sensing module. It outlines the rationale behind component choices and design modifications.
Failure Management: Describes the processes implemented for failure management in PCB design, including Electrical Rule Check (ERC), Design Rule Check (DRC), Design for Manufacturing (DFM), troubleshooting design, and circuit testing.
System Integration and Interfacing: Details the interfacing specifications and connections of the sensing subsystem with other components of the Micro-Mouse project. Includes an interfacing diagram and table describing the connections.
Acceptance Testing: Provides a comprehensive overview of acceptance tests conducted to verify that all components function as expected and meet requirements and specifications. Each test is described along with its testing procedure and pass/fail criteria.
Repository Structure:
Data sheets: data sheets for components.
Schematics: Includes schematic diagrams of the initial and final circuit designs for the sensing module.
PCB production files: includes items needed to manufacture the board

Usage:
This repository serves as a reference for understanding the design and testing procedures of the Micro-Mouse sensing subsystem. Developers and engineers can utilize the documentation and schematics for further development or troubleshooting.
